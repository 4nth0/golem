# For this first example service, we create a service of the type HTTP,
# this is the default type, so there is no need to specify the type.

# This type of service allows you to start an HTTP server and attach routes to it.

# For this service, we do not want to listen on a specific port,
# the routes created will therefore be accessible on the main port declared
# at the beginning of this file, namely 3000 in our case.
port: "3000"
